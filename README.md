# rodeoExt: Extensions to the 'rodeo' Package

The package 'rodeo' (R ODE Objects) defines an 'R6' class
  to work with ordinary and partial differential equation models in
  stoichiometry notation and to generate computational efficient
  Fortran code. The aim of this package is to extend this class with
  additional information and to provide convenience functions to make
  working with 'rodeo' models easier.
