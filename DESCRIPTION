Description: The package 'rodeo' (R ODE Objects) defines an 'R6' class to work with ordinary and partial differential equation models in stoichiometry notation and to generate computational efficient Fortran code. The aim of this package is to extend this class with additional information and to provide convenience functions to make working with 'rodeo' models easier.
